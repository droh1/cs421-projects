Final update:

project1.c is the kernel code, while skiplist.c/h is the prototype.

-Issues:
	>project1.c does not compile properly due to what seems to be errors in list.h and kernel.h.
	 I am unable to find the source of these errors and can get it to be fixed.

-Note to grader:
	>The code in project1.c is a list impmentation, I commented out the skiplist impmnentation in attempts
	 to try to work out the errors. I beleve the logic for the skiplist impmentation and the syscalls make
	 sense, but given how it does not compile I guess I thought the skiplist imporoperly.
	>Appolgies in advance for the broken code (T.T)
